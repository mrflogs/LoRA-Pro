# LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?

This repo contains the pre-release version of LoRA-Pro, proposed by [LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gTwRMU3lJ5).

In LoRA-Pro, we uncover a fundamental connection between the optimization processes of LoRA and full fine-tuning: using LoRA for optimization is mathematically equivalent to full fine-tuning using a low-rank gradient for parameter updates. And this low-rank gradient can be expressed in terms of the gradients of the two low-rank matrices in LoRA. Leveraging this insight, we introduce LoRA-Pro, a method that enhances LoRA's performance by strategically adjusting the gradients of these low-rank matrices. This adjustment allows the low-rank gradient to more accurately approximate the full fine-tuning gradient, thereby narrowing the performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning. Furthermore, we theoretically derive the optimal solutions for adjusting the gradients of the low-rank matrices, applying them during fine-tuning in LoRA-Pro.



## Requirements

### Installation

Create a conda environment and install dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mrflogs/LoRA-Pro.git
cd LoRA-Pro

conda activate -n lorapro python=3.9
conda activate lorapro

# install required package
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
pip install -r requirements.txt

# install modified deepspeed
pip install -e DeepSpeed-0.15.1
```

### Datasets and Models

Install Llama-2-7B from huggingface and link it to `./models`.

Install datasets (WizardLM, MetaMathQA, and CodeFeedback-Filtered-Instruction, etc.) from huggingface and link them to `./data`.

## Get Started

### Example

In LoRA-Pro, to ensure compatibility with DeepSpeed, we've integrated the Adam optimization process directly into DeepSpeed (in `DeepSpeed-0.15.1/deepspeed/runtime/zero/stage_1_and_2.py`). Therefore, in the TrainingArguments, **you need to set the optimizer to "sgd" to prevent parameters from being updated twice.**

#### 0. Training 

```python
# Define your LoRA


# Define TrainingArguments, keep optim as "sgd" here.
train_args = TrainingArguments(
	...,
    optim="sgd",
	...,
)

# LoRA-Pro Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    train_dataset=datasets["train"],
    eval_dataset=datasets["eval"],
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    args=train_args,
    data_collator=default_data_collator,
)

# Train
trainer.train()
```

### Reproduce Llama-2-7b results

For code task, we generate results with script below and evaluate its PASS@1 using [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval), 

```shell
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 evaluation/eval_llama-2_code_multi_gpus.py
```

For chat task, we use [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main) to generation and evaluate with GPT-4, please read their instruction.
